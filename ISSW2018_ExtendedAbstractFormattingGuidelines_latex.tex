\section{INTRODUCTION}
All ISSW presenters - both oral and poster presenters - are required to submit a 1–5 page extended abstract that describes their presentation topic in more detail for publication in the ISSW 2018 proceedings. At this ISSW, the conference proceedings will only be published electronically.
%
% ===================================================================================================
\section{MANUSCRIPT DEADLINE}
Manuscripts must be received by \textbf{\underline{August 13, 2018}.}\\

\noindent
We cannot guarantee that late papers will be included in the conference line-up and the proceedings publication. \textbf{Your oral or poster presentation slot is conditional on us receiving your paper by this date.}
%
% ===================================================================================================
\section{LANGUAGE} 
Extended abstracts may be submitted in English, German, Italian or French. However, authors should consider that their contributions will be printed as submitted. German, Italian and French papers will not be translated to English. Therefore, authors are greatly encouraged to submit their papers in English, since they have a far wider reach.
%
% ===================================================================================================
\section{PAGE LIMIT, LAYOUT \& TEXT FONT}
Extended abstracts are limited to \textbf{\underline{no more than 5}} \textbf{\underline{pages}}, including references, appendices, etc. and must be formatted on A4 pages (210 mm x 297 mm) with 2.5 cm (about 1 inch) margins on all sides. In word, please use the styles and formatting templates provided within this document (‘ISSW - …’), or 10-point Arial for the text body.
Place the text in newspaper style columns with a 0.8 cm space between columns. If necessary, figures, photos, or charts may span the two columns, adhering to the 2.5 cm margins.
%
\subsection{Titles, headings and footnotes}
The title of the paper should be centered and typed in CAPITAL LETTERS on the first line of your first page of your manuscript. Type the name of all the author(s) in initial caps and center on the page two lines below the title. Type the author's affiliation, city, and country on the line below their name in initial caps.\\
%
\noindent
Major headings are Arabic-numbered in CAPITAL LETTERS (as shown in these instructions). Secondary headings are in italics and underlined (as shown in these instructions). Footnotes should be indicated in the text with an asterisk (*).\\
%
\noindent
Do not include any page numbers, headers or footers in your manuscript.
%
\subsection{Author’s corresponding address}
Please type, within the 2.5 cm margin, the corresponding author's address in the lower left corner of your first page (see lower left corner of the first page of these instructions).
%
\subsection{References}
List all bibliographic references at the end of the paper in alphabetical order by first author. When referring to them in the text, type the corresponding author’s surname, followed by the year of publication, e.g. \cite{McClung2006}. When there are three or more authors, use the first author’s name followed by “et al.”, e.g. \cite{Greene2006}. Use referencing style as used in Cold Regions Science and Technology (see sample references at the end of these instructions).
%
\subsection{Equation numbers}
Enclose these Arabic (and sequential) numbers in parentheses and place flush with right-hand margin of column.
%
\subsection{Units}
The International System of Units (SI units) should be used in the ISSW Proceedings.
%
% ===================================================================================================
\section{FIGURES, TABLES AND CAPTIONS}
Presentations at the conference do not usually allow enough time for in-depth understanding; therefore, it is important to include your most complex graphs, diagrams, etc., in your extended abstract.\\
%
\noindent
Figures and tables should be reduced so that they may be incorporated into the text along with the appropriate pages, with full captions typed in (see Figure \ref{fig.issw_logo}).\\
\noindent
All color photographs should be in RGB color space, and at least 160 ppi at the size shown in your manuscript. A table or figure that cannot be placed in the same orientation as the text should be rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise so that the figure and caption may be read by rotating the published proceedings 90 degrees clockwise. Company logos and identification numbers are not permitted on your illustrations.
